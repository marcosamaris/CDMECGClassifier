# Classification of Electrocardiograms of Myocardial Infartion with CDM in Scilab

This paper shows the work continuity of the Research Group in Biomedical Engineering (GIIB
for its acronym in Spanish) in the area of electrophysiological signal processing, about developing
and building applications oriented for the heart disease detection, in this case the Acute Myocardial
Infarction. This research was focused on the use of two data mining techniques, Compression-based
Disimilarity Measure and Symbolic Agreggate AproXimation, for classification of the Heart Rate Variability of electrocardiographic signals using machine learning unsupervised.

To make possible a good classification of signal electrocardiographic a filter process is performed,
the respective characterization of the waves, and extracting of the HRV using wavelet analysis tools;
this process is named preprocessing, then data mining techniques are used for the data transformation
and data classification; for the last reason the results of this research are mentioned like a methodology
for knowledge discovery in databases.


A theoretical foundation of the techniques based similarity measures in compression is presented,
the theorical bases of these techniques are based in the Kolmogorov complexity, this paper defines
key concepts of this complexity and some analogies with the Shannon’s information theory, also a few
applications in machine learning for classification between time series, images, DNA, video, audio etc.

Important concepts about the wavelet analysis over electrocardiographic signal with the environment for statistical computing R.
All the algorithms and graphical user interface were develop in the
software environment for statistical computing R, R satisfied all the needs, and provides the ability to
easily develop parallel algorithms, for his data models based on lists.
